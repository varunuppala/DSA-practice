The Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University is seeking applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in Computer Science. For the first year of this position, the successful candidate will also hold the title of Provostâ€™s Distinguished Faculty Fellow, and will have no teaching and service responsibilities to allow a focus on research while receiving mentorship and support from two senior faculty members. Candidates with a strong record of research in fairness and ethics in computing, computing for social good, machine learning and artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer systems, databases, trustworthy computing, human-computer interaction, or software engineering are encouraged to apply. We are a rapidly growing department in a top-25 university located in the heart of Washington, DC. Our faculty research focuses on data-centered computing, security and privacy, and theory. We are committed to building a diverse intellectual community and strongly encourage applications from those from underrepresented backgrounds.
